Seed content copied verbatim from `old-wikis/` (e.g. a day theme literally
called "Tournament Day") is exempt: it is historical data, not code, and the
banned-term scan only covers `src/`, `scripts/`, and `drizzle/`.

## Seed idempotence rules

A seed file loads in one transaction. Loading the same file twice leaves the
same rows with the same values (only `updated_at` moves).

- `war_week` rows are upserted by `edition`, the seed's natural key.
- **Setup data** is owned by the seed. Each row is upserted by its natural
  key within the War Week, and any row absent from the seed is deleted, so
  setup always matches the seed exactly after a load:
  - Day: `(war_week_id, date)`
  - Schedule Item: `(day_id, start_time, title)`
  - Team: `(war_week_id, name)`
  - Participant: `(war_week_id, display_name)`
  - Competition: `(war_week_id, name)`
  - FAQ Item: `(war_week_id, question)`; sort order is the position in the
    seed's `faqItems` list

  Seed references between entities use these names (a Points Entry names its
  Competition, Team or Participant). Removing a Team, Participant or
  Competition from the seed also deletes its Points Entries and Award
  recipients, and renaming one counts as a removal plus an addition, so fix
  spellings before organizers start entering points.
  - Changing a Competition's `scoring` in the seed does not re-check its
    existing Points Entries; the target-kind rule is enforced in zod (seed
    files and organizer actions), not the database.
- **Organizer-owned data** is seed-initialized but never clobbered:
  - `standings_hidden` is applied only when a War Week is first inserted.
  - Points Entries, Awards (with their recipients) and Announcements in a
    seed carry a `key`. The loader inserts a keyed record only when no record
    with that key exists, and never updates or deletes one. Records organizers
    create in the app have no key and are never touched by a load. Adding a
    new keyed record to a seed and reloading adds just that record.
